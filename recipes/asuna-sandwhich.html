        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a really easy recipe, it takes no time and it’s really yummy.</p>
        <p>This is the sandwich Asuan gives Kirito when they are in the dungeon.</p>
         <h3>Ingridients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>half pack stew meat</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon teriyaki sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
             <li>1 teaspoon Tonkatsu sauce </li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>vegetable oil to cover the pan</li>
            <li>2 slices of bread, either white or Italian</li>
            <li>Mayo just enough to spread on the bread</li>
            <li>any kind of greens or lettuces</li>
         </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>heat up the oil in a pan on medium and add the meat with salt and pepper. until all the meat is browned.</li>
            <li>Once all of that has browned then add all the sauces to the pan and cook till the meat is at desired doneness. About 30 minuets for the meat to be medium.</li>
            <li>When that is done get your bread ready and layer one side with mayo. I didnt add that much since I am not a really big fan of mayo.</li>
            <li>clean dry and add the greens to the bread. I used romaine and parsley, I also like mizuna, and mesclun lettuces as well.</li>
            <li>and finally add the meat! I liked it it’s really yummy I can see why Kirito wouldnt want to share anything Asuna made.</li>
        </ol>
